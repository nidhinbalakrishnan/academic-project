Proximity based Sentiment Analysis with Contextual Phrase Polarity

Sentiment Analysis is used to identify and extract subjective information in source material in source materials with the use of Natural Language Processing and various other techniques. In this project, we are using a new methodology for Sentiment Analysis called Proximity based Sentiment Analysis. In addition to this, we are also considering Phrase Polarity in order to improve the accuracy of the result. Also we are trying to implement a Dynamic dictionary to optimise the dictionary size and to improve the access time.
